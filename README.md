# NWS-SCANNER
scans NWS website and uses it for TTS ONLY WORKS WITH PYTHON RUNNING MACHINES 

Open the NWSSCANNER EXE and after a few seconds it should work.

After closing the audio will keep playing for about 5 seconds then stop. This is because of the delay of the program closing and the TTS stoping.

This program is automaticly set to tell weather in arizona. you can use python to change this to you own city.

The time will change based on you computer time.


You will have to change the WSLG radio callsign that occurs every 5 minutes. This is for my radio staion that i host in Glendale Arizona. You can remove this feature if you please.

Report any crashes/bugs to me.
